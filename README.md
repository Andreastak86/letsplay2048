**HOW TO PLAY 2048:**

Use your arrow keys (↑ ↓ → ←) to slide all tiles on the board
When two tiles with identical numbers collide, they combine into one tile with the sum of their values
After each move, a new tile will appear with a value of 2 or 4
Plan your moves carefully to combine tiles and reach 2048
The game ends when you either:

Win by creating a 2048 tile
Lose when the board is full and no more moves are possible
